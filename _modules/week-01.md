: **Lecture**{: .label .label-green } Potential Outcomes and DAGs
: Causal identification via the potential outcomes framework, the structural equation framework and its DAG representation. Single world intervention graphs (SWIGs) and identification by adjustment. Proof of D-separation implies conditional independence.
