---

May 9
: **Lecture**{: .label .label-green } Non-Parametric Confidence Intervals
: Non-parametric confidence intervals, random forests and nearest neighbors. Proof of asymptotic linearity for kernel based moment estimators. Proof of bias for k-NN and (maybe proof of bias for Trees). Proof of confidence intervals with nuisance parameters and local orthogonality.
